Below are the instructions for running the iOS application that I have developed:

Please note that this only works for the Mac Operating System, so if you are on Windows, I would suggest installing MacOS on a virtual machine



    1. Download the XCode IDE from this link https://developer.apple.com/xcode/, or simply from the App Store
        (This application might take a while to download because it is about 20-25 GB in size)

    2. Open up the Product folder of this submission, navigate to the 'mealPlanner' folder and open the mealPlanner.xcworkspace file in XCode

    3. Once the file has been opened in the XCode IDE, at the top of the app, you will see an option to change which device the app will run on - select any of the iPhone 12 models

    4. Finally, click the run button (â–¸) in the top left 

    5. This will open up the application in an iOS Simulator window and you can navigate through the application.
